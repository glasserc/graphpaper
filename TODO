More sophisticated dependencies/conflictions? Boolean expressions, instead of
lists of "all these"?

Dependency resolver?

Some kind of representation of causality? i.e. this switch triggers this square to change from "present" to "not present".

Pages? (I think this will probably be implemented using a (page, place, propname) addressing in the graphpaper, and a notebook of pages of GraphPaperViews in the main function.)

Undo/redo (keep track of the lists of operations that you perform; each list is an undo/redo command, just be prepared to reverse it).

Signals which need to be emitted:
- motion over property
- dragging?

Some kind of "adjacent" mode for connection properties?
- drawings are done separately. Reliance on additional properties? (For instance, in some fields, "one_way" needs the presence of a wall. In other fields, maybe the wall isn't necessary or clutters up the screen?)
